## A: End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Beth Sebian
Challenge: Shopping List
Notes: N/A

### Scores:
**1. Ruby Syntax & API**
* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

**2. Completion and Progress**
* 4: Developer fully completes baseline assignment and one of the Challenge options.**

**3. Testing**
* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

**4. Workflow**
* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

**5. Collaboration**
* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

**6. Enumerable & Collections**
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

### Sorting Suite

(project description)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AELSchauer/turing-sorting_suite)
* [Original Assignment]()

### Date Night

(project description)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AELSchauer/turing-date_night)
* [Original Assignment]()

#### Evaluation

Assessed By: Mike

##### Notes:
* Generally very thorough testing, but check to see that youre actually testing what data contains.

##### Scores:

**1. Functional Expectations**
* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions

**2. Test-Driven Development**
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

**3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components**
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

**4. Fundamental Ruby & Style**
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

**5. Looping or Recursion**
* 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques


### Battleship

(project description)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AELSchauer/turing-complete_me)
* [Original Assignment]()

#### Evaluation

Assessed By: Mike

##### Notes:
* Clean REPL.
* App crashes after ship placement.
* Some pretty complex logic in the CoordinatesGenerator class
* Good use of enumerables, good style
* Think about how methods can receive and send messages - this makes testing much easier.

##### Scores:
**1. Fundamental Ruby & Style**
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

**2. Enumerable & Collections**
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

**3. Test-Driven Development**
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

**4. REPL Interface**
* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

**5. Breaking Logic into Components**
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

**6. Functional Expectations**
* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.


## C: Group Work & Projects

(Intro)

### (Complete Me)

#### Evaluation

Assessed By: Nate
Notes: N/A

#### 1. Functional Expectations
**4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension**

2. Test-Driven Development
**4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data**

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
**4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility**

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
**3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring**

5. Enumerable & Collections
**3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods**

##### Partner Feedback
*Ashley -*

*I really enjoyed working with you. I admire your intellectual capability and technical skill. I felt that we had a great working relationship and that we did well to achieve the project goals.*

*Specifically, what I learned most from you was your ability to clearly draw and whiteboard concepts, to use tools and frameworks to communicate about and logically solve problems.*

*As we've discussed, one of your significant challenges is how to manage the fact that you're so strong in this subject matter. I admired your ability and intention to work together when you had a more clear vision of how to move forward.*

*I think the time that we did run into a significant issue with the parsing of the weighted hashes, I saw your true problem solving self; who you are when you're challenged come to the fore. In those moments I felt like you have a tendency to go a bit more into a cave to grind and hack the problem out. This makes sense. But I will say there may be an opportunity for you to notice when that happens and to find new tools and tricks to bring your partner into that space in a helpful way. That ability to stop and reflect on where you are in the process is a place where you could find a lot of growth.*

*But on the whole I really enjoyed our dynamic. I think you are good and getting better at communicating and that it's important for you to seek out new challenges and discomfort.*

*I said at our first meeting that I'd like this to be the start of a long term intellectual partnership. I still would like that, and for friendship too.*
