Notes:

Clean REPL.
App crashes after ship placement.
Some pretty complex logic in the CoordinatesGenerator class
Good use of enumerables, good style
think about how methods can receive and send messages - this makes testing much easier.

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
2. Enumerable & Collections

3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques
3. Test-Driven Development

2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
4. REPL Interface

3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use
5. Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
6. Functional Expectations

2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
