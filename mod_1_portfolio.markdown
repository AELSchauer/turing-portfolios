##### Partner Feedback
*Ashley -*

*I really enjoyed working with you. I admire your intellectual capability and technical skill. I felt that we had a great working relationship and that we did well to achieve the project goals.*

*Specifically, what I learned most from you was your ability to clearly draw and whiteboard concepts, to use tools and frameworks to communicate about and logically solve problems.*

*As we've discussed, one of your significant challenges is how to manage the fact that you're so strong in this subject matter. I admired your ability and intention to work together when you had a more clear vision of how to move forward.*

*I think the time that we did run into a significant issue with the parsing of the weighted hashes, I saw your true problem solving self; who you are when you're challenged come to the fore. In those moments I felt like you have a tendency to go a bit more into a cave to grind and hack the problem out. This makes sense. But I will say there may be an opportunity for you to notice when that happens and to find new tools and tricks to bring your partner into that space in a helpful way. That ability to stop and reflect on where you are in the process is a place where you could find a lot of growth.*

*But on the whole I really enjoyed our dynamic. I think you are good and getting better at communicating and that it's important for you to seek out new challenges and discomfort.*

*I said at our first meeting that I'd like this to be the start of a long term intellectual partnership. I still would like that, and for friendship too.*
